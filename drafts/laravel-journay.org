The problems I encountered while using laravel(5.6.29)

To enable the debug mode first, find the line "'debug' => env('APP_DEBUG', false)"
in <root>/config/app.php and change it to true. If debug mode is disabled, then
you will get in trouble soon and can't get out of it easily.

Problem1: Startup even does not work.
    After project created, you need to execute
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    composer install
    #+END_SRC

    (I don't know if it matters that where to execute this command)

    so that you can execute
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    php artisan serve
    #+END_SRC
    then.

Problem2: When you access "http://localhost:8000/" in browser, you will see a message
"RuntimeException No application encryption key has been specified." if the debug mode
has been enabled, "Whoops something looks something went wrong", otherwise.

    To solve this problem, I executed "php artisan key:generate". However,
    another problem was raised.

Problem3: The problem raised messages "ErrorException  : file_get_contents(/home/salt/
Documents/code/php/blog/.env): failed to open stream: No such file or directory". Yep,
missing the file.

    After googling, I found there is a .env.example in /home/salt/Documents/code/php/blog/.
    For I am lazy, I copy it and rename the file o ".env". And now it works.


Problem4: Almost forget to record this, yeah, the router, i.e, urls defined in
"/home/salt/Documents/code/php/blog/web.php".


Problem5: POST request
